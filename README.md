Resources to assist in compliance with PCI DSS in the airport common use environment
This project is the result of work started in the payments group of the IATA common use working group.
The aim was to produce material to help airlines, airports and QSAs to meet and describe their PCI compliance resonsibilities.
The main output is a spreadsheet that describes a number of areas of responsibility in the common use environment of an airport,
along with the PCI DSS requirements associated with the that responsibility.
The spreadsheet and requirements won't be an accurate picture of your airline or airort, but it will be a great place to start.
Feel free to use it, modify it and improve it - and please share your experience.
This is the work of many people, the most credit lies with Jim Knaeble of Rockwell Collins Arinc for maintaining the project
over a number of years.
This repository is 'managed' by John Elliott - who is not a common use vendor (or an airport).
